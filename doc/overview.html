A conditions data framework for the ILC - based on <a href="http://lcio.desy.de">LCIO</a>.

<p>Upcoming testbeam efforts will need a way to store and retrieve conditions data, e.g. 
slow control, electronics setup and calibration constants. 
Typically experiments use a 'conditions database' for this purpose. 
While a database offers you all the functionality that is required 
(varying validity time ranges, tags, history, etc.) it also puts some burden on the users
as they have to set up and maintain a data base system. <br>
A simpler approach is to store conditions data in LCIO files that are used for the data itself 
anyhow.<br>
While being straight forward and easy to implement this approach lacks some of the desired
features  for conditions data  like tags, versioning and history. 
<p>
LCCD is a toolkit that combines the two options in a transparent way.
It is implemented in C++ and uses an Open Source implementation of a conditions database 
interface developed for the Atlas experiment:

<h2>Overview</h2>

LCCD is a conditions data toolkit that is based on LCIO. It allows to handle 
arbitrary conditions data as long as they are expressed in terms of LCIO classes.
As long as you don't need the full database functionality you can use LCCD together with 
LCIO only. The main purpose is to provide an easy to use interface to read conditions data in
any program that analyzes LCIO data. There are four different uses cases (scenarios) implemented
in LCCD:
<ol>
<li>Read conditions data that is valid for the time specified by the time stamp in the current 
LCEvent on the fly from a data base. Typically one wants to do this for a given tag that is 
known to reference data with approved quality (e.g. calibration, channel mapping, etc.). 
This is the most general case usually needed in a full reconstruction job.</li>
<li>Read one particular set of conditions data, e.g. calibration constants from an LCIO file in a small
job. This is the simplest case that can be used to check certain conditions data and distribute it to
a group of people.</li>
<li>Read conditions data that occures in the data stream of an LCIO file. 
This can be used to analyze data that has been created by a DAQ that writes some slow 
control information into the data stream online. For example there might be a temerature reading every 
minute during data taking. This sort of conditions data will simply be valid from the event where it was
stored until the next event with a newer version of this particular data is read.
</li>
<li>Read conditions data from an LCIO file that has been created in a special way, so that it holds the 
data for a given time range with consecutive validity intervalls in consecutive events. lccd::DBInterface
provides a method to create such a file from a database folder for a given tag. This can be used to 
distribute conditions data with validity range information to systems where no data base is available. 
One scenario where this might be usefull is grid computing where you can't necessarily expect to
have access to a database.
</li>
</ol>
All four use cases are implemented through the common interface lccd::IConditionsHandler. This ensures 
that user code can be writen without making any assumption on how the conditions data is actually 
provided at run time.

<p>
While most users will only be interested in reading the conditions data someone has to actually create
the data and make it available. The lccd::DBInterface provides easy to use methods 
to store and tag the data in a conditions database. 
The only requirement is that the data is available in an LCCollection of LCGenericObject 
subclasses. The data itself is stored as a BLOB (binary large object) in the database. LCCD provides 
streamer code for LCGenericObjects that is machine independent (using XDR). By implementing a suitable 
lccd::VCollectionStreamer users can in principle store any data they like in the data base. But they 
have to keep in mind that as long as there is no corresponding LCIO class they won't be able to
use LCIO files transparently.

<h2>Conditions Database</h2>
For the conditions database LCCD uses
<a href="http://savannah.cern.ch/projects/conddb-mysql/">ConditionsDBMySQL</a>. This is an open source 
implementation of the ConditionsDB interface from CERN that has been developed by the Lisbon ATLAS 
group.<br>
The main features of the database are:
<ul>
<li>data is stored in folders, similar to directories in a unix file system.</li>
<li>one folder contains one particular type of conditions data for all time intervalls</li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
</ul>
